# OP Pickaxe
This mod adds a pickaxe that just insta-mines blocks. Also it cannot be crafted in surival, **it's too op**. You can also do 20 hearts of damage, enough to kill a player.

## Why?
Because yes.

## Why is this description so bad?
idk

But its actually satisfying, and it's unbreakable, also heres my modrinth: https://modrinth.com/user/ItsFlifteen8
